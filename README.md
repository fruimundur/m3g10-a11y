For this project I created a simple landing page focusing in making it accessible.

Please note that I did not spend any time on making it responsible, so remember to view it in desktop mode.


To make the website fully accessible I applied these things:

* I added hover effects on the links in the nav bar

* I added a border on the focus states, so people using the tab key on the keyboard to navigate can see where they are

* I used all the relevant semantic HTML tags: header, nav, article, section, button and footer, so a screen reader can read out which content each specific element represents

* I used an aria-label attribute in the opening anchor tag for the "logo" in the top left of the website. I used the aria-label to name this element "Home button". The reason for using an aria-label is that there isn't any relevant semantic tags for this purpose

* I used color contrast to make everything clear and visible

* I used the recommended 16px font size for the body text and then various slightly bigger sizes for headings, nav bar links and the CTA sentence at the bottom.


Finally, I would like to recommend installing the 'screen reader' extension in Chrome, and then clicking on each element on the page.
